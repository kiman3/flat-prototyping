# Web layout prototyping
The simplest setup for _web layout sketching_ with code.

## Key features
* 12 column grid system with gutter variables (Customized [Flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid))
* Normalizing and baseline styles in place, so you can focus on the fun parts
* [swup](https://github.com/swup/swup) for unobtrusive page transitions
* jQuery ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
* [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/) animation engine
* Super simple PHP templating system for includes.
* Grid widget to check if things align. Toggle by pressing "g".
* No-js/js check, sets relevant class on body
* Everything works offline, no CDNs etc.

## Requirements
Local server setup (MAMP or similar). Just download and place files in your htdocs or similar. And you should use Sass if you can, although a clean CSS file is also provided.
