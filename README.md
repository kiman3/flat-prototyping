# Web layout prototyping
The simplest setup for _web layout sketching_ with code.

## Key features
* 12 column grid system ([Flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid))
* Normalizing and baseline styles in place, so you can focus on the fun parts
* jQuery ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
* [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/) animation engine
* [smoothState.js](https://github.com/miguel-perez/smoothState.js) for unobtrusive page transitions
* Super simple PHP templating system for includes.
* No-js/js check, sets relevant class on body
* Everything works offline, no CDNs etc.

## Requirements
Local server setup (MAMP or similar). Just download and place files in your htdocs or similar. And you should use Sass if you can, although a clean CSS file is also provided.
