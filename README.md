# Web layout prototyping
Simple setup for web layout sketching with code.

## Key features
* 12 column grid system with gutter variables (Customized [Flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid))
* Normalizing and baseline styles in place, so you can focus on the fun parts
* [swup](https://github.com/swup/swup) for unobtrusive page transitions
* jQuery
* [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/) animation engine
* Simple PHP templating system for includes.
* Grid widget to check if things align. Add from js-snippets.js. Toggle by pressing "g".
* No-js/js check, sets relevant class on body
* Everything works offline, no CDNs etc.

## Requirements
Since it uses PHP, you need a local server setup (MAMP or similar). Just download and place files in your htdocs or your equivalent.
