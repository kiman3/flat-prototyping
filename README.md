# Flat prototyping
Simple setup for web prototyping, enabling code as a design tool with as little hassle as possible.

## Requirements
Local server setup (MAMP or similar) and Codekit. Should probably make this project independent of Codekit at some point.

## Features
### Flexboxgrid
Using the excellent https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid for a simple 12 column grid system and basic Flexbox capabilities.

### PHP
Simple template system with includes for header and footer. No magic. PHP is totally fine for this.

### Offline
jQuery, Velocity and smoothState included, no CDNs. Great for prototyping on the go, right.

### SCSS and Codekit
Speed matters in prototypes too: Sass setup that minifies all styles. Codekit powered minifying of JS.
